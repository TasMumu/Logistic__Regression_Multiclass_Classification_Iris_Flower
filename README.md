# Logistic__Regression_Multiclass_Classification_Iris_Flower
**Problem Statement:** Classify an IRIS flower into one of the three categories ['setosa', 'versicolor', 'virginica'] based on their petal and sepal width and height. We will use logistic regression for this classification problem

📌 **Project Highlights:**

* Implemented **Logistic Regression** for multiclass classification
* Split data into training and testing sets
* Evaluated model performance using:

  * **Accuracy**
  * **Precision**
  * **Recall**
  * **F1-Score**
  * **Confusion Matrix**

**Key Results:**

* ✅ **Accuracy:** ~97.8%
* Strong and balanced **precision & recall** across all classes
* Clear understanding of how different classes perform individually using the **classification report**

**What I Learned:**

* How Logistic Regression extends to **multiclass problems**
* The importance of evaluating models beyond accuracy
* Practical interpretation of **precision, recall, F1-score**, and **confusion matrix**
* End-to-end ML workflow inside **Jupyter Notebook**

This project helped strengthen my fundamentals in **machine learning classification and model evaluation**, which are crucial for real-world applications like customer segmentation, churn prediction, and fraud detection.
